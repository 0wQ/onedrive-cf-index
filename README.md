### All other features

See: [New features | OneDrive-Index-Cloudflare-Worker](https://github.com/heymind/OneDrive-Index-Cloudflare-Worker#-%E6%96%B0%E7%89%B9%E6%80%A7-v11).

## Deployment

> Online token generation tool taken from the generous: <https://heymind.github.io/tools/microsoft-graph-api-auth>.

### Prerequisites

#### Get OneDrive API Tokens

1. Create new blade app here: [Microsoft Azure App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) with:
   1. `Supported account types` set to "Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)".
   2. `Redirect URI (optional)` set to "Web: https://heymind.github.io/tools/microsoft-graph-api-auth".
2. Get your Application (client) ID which is `client_id` at `Overview` panel.
3. Open `Certificates & secrets` panel and create a new secret called `client_secret`.
4. Add permissions `offline_access, Files.Read, Files.Read.All` at `API permissions`.
5. Get your `refresh_token` using <https://heymind.github.io/tools/microsoft-graph-api-auth>.
6. Create a dedicated folder for your public files inside OneDrive, for instance: `/Public`.

#### Get Firebase Database Tokens

1. Register new project at [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
2. Enable "Realtime Database" at "Develop ¬ª Database", create a key called `auth` and get the URL for your database as `firebase_url` (which should look like `https://xxx.firebaseio.com/auth.json`.).
3. Set database rules to be: `".read": false` and `".write": false`.
4. Get your database token `firebase_token` at "Settings ¬ª Service Accounts ¬ª Database key".

After all this hassle, you should have successfully acquired the following tokens and secrets:

- `refresh_token`
- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- `redirect_uri`: <https://heymind.github.io/tools/microsoft-graph-api-auth> (default)
- `base`: '/Public' (default)
- `firebase_url`
- `firebase_token`

### Preparing

Fork the repository. Install dependencies.

```sh
# Install cloudflare workers official packing and publishing tool
yarn global add @cloudflare/wrangler

# Install dependencies with yarn
yarn install

# Login to Cloudflare with wrangler
wrangler config

# Verify wrangler status with this command
wrangler whoami
```

Create a **DRAFT** worker at Cloudflare Workers with a cool name. Get your own Cloudflare `account_id` and `zone_id`.

Modify [`wrangler.toml`](wrangler.toml):

- `name`: The draft worker's name, your worker will be published at `<name>.<worker_subdomain>.workers.dev`.
- `account_id`: Your Cloudflare Account ID.
- `zone_id`: Your Cloudflare Zone ID.

Modify [`src/config/default.js`](src/config/default.js):

- `client_id`: Your `client_id` from above.
- `base`: Your `base` path from above.
- `firebase_url`: Your `firebase_url` from above.

Add secrets to Cloudflare Workers environment variables with `wrangler`:

```sh
# Add your refresh_token, client_secret, firebase_token to Cloudflare
wrangler secret put REFRESH_TOKEN
# ... enter your refresh_token from above here

wrangler secret put CLIENT_SECRET
# ... enter your client_secret from above here

wrangler secret put FIREBASE_TOKEN
# ... enter your firebase_token from above here
```

### Building and publishing

You can preview the worker with `wrangler`:

```sh
wrangler preview
```

After making sure everything is ok, you can publish your worker with:

```sh
wrangler publish
```

You can also create a GitHub Actions for auto publishing your worker on `push`. See [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml).

### Customizations

- You can **(AND SHOULD)** change the `intro` on the default landing page here: [src/folderView.js](src/folderView.js#L51-L55). Write HTML directly.
- Your custom styles are loaded from [themes/spencer.css](themes/spencer.css), change that according to your customizations.
- You can also customize Markdown CSS styles, PrismJS code highlight color schemes, etc.
